##Similarity between Normal and Binomial

This is a simple application to show the similarity between Normal and Binomial distribution. There are 3 inputs:

1) Number of trials in the Binomial distribution.

2) Mean (success rate) of the Binomial distribution.

3) The third parameter could be "Binomial" or "Normal" and the output plot shows the distribution.

###Binomial
If you choose "Binomial" then the application plots a histogram of a "Binomial" distribution (divided by the number of trials). You can change the success rate (mean) and number of trials and look at the change in the distribution. The application also calculates the standard deviation of the distribution and prints the value.

###Normal
If you choose "Normal" then the application plots a histogram of a Normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation of the equivalent Binomial distribution. You can again change the mean and number of trials. 

Using this application we can see that when the number of trials goes up, the Binomial and Normal distributions are similar.
